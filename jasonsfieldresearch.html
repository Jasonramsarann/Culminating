<h2>What is an Artficial Neural Network?</h2>
<p style="color:black"><font size="4">An artificial neural network or ANN is a type of computing system made to imitate the human brain. Its main purpose is to try and imitate the way that the human brain works to analyze and process information. ANN is the building block of artificial intelligence. It helps solve problems that would otherwise be too hard or complicated for a human to handle. ANN’s are capable of self-learning which allows them to perform better as they receive more data. They are comprised of dozens to millions of artificial neurons called processing units that enable inputs and outputs; inputs being what the ANN learns from do produce a certain output. </p>

<h2>History of Artificial Neural Networks</h2>
<p style="color:black"><font size="4">In 1943, neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts had a theory about how neurons worked. For them to describe how neurons in the brain might work, they created a model of a  simple neural network using electrical circuits. This was the beginning of what the modern ANN would look like. ​​In 1949, Donald Hebb wrote The Organization of Behavior. This piece of work pointed out the fact that neural pathways are strengthened each time they are used, a concept that is important for the way that humans learn. Donald Hebb said that if two nerves fire at the same time, the connection between them is strengthened. As computers advanced in the 1950s, it became possible to create the first real model of an artificial neural network. The first attempt to create a neural network was done so by a man named Nathanial Rochester. He attempted to do this at IBM research laboratories but was deemed unsuccessful. In 1959, Bernard Widrow and Marcian Hoff from Stanford created models named "Adaline" and "Madeline." Adeline stood for: Multiple ADAptive LINear Elements. Thus creating the acronym, ADALINE. Adeline was created to recognize binary patterns so that if it was reading streaming bits from a phone line, it could predict the next bit. MADALINE was the first neural network that was used to solve a real-world problem by using an adaptive filter that eliminates echoes on phone lines. Although Madeline is as old as air traffic control systems, it is still in use today.</p> <img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/562/AEaWQm.png" width=700 height=300>




<h2>Understanding Neural Networks</h2>
<p style="color:black"><font size="4">Artificial Neural Networks are a part of deep learning, where computer and embedded systems learn to recognize different patterns and perform assigned tasks. For example, an object recognition system would be fed to a bunch of images of cars, houses, animals etc so that eventually it will be able to correlate those pictures with defined labels in the future. These neural networks are inspired from the neural networks of our brain. In fact, it is modeled loosely to compare to a human brain and can have millions of simple nodes which are called perceptrons that are interconnected with each other. To be familiarized with the network architecture, there consists of an input layer (leftmost), and the neurons within this layer are called input neurons. The outermost layer is the rightmost layer and is where all the output takes place. The output layer consists simply of a single neuron. Between the inner and outer layer, there are many middle layers that consist of many interconnected neurons. These are also known as hidden layers as all the neurons are connected in different ways. Each layer consists of multiple nodal rows which further contain neural nodes that act like switches and can turn on or off similar to binary (0,1). Thus, each layer’s input is its subsequent output.

<h2>Types of Artificial Neural Networks</h2>
<p style="color:black"><font size="4">There are many types of artificial neural networks. These types are implemented from the differing mathematical operations in a set of parameters which is required to determine the overall output. However, there are 3 main ones that will be explained. The first example of this is Feedforward Neural Network – Artificial Neuron.  This is one of the simplest types of ANN and it works where the data received goes in one direction. It will go through the input nodes and out the output ones. Another one is the Radial basis function Neural Network. This works by looking at the distance of a point from the centre. These types of functions have 2 layers: the first one where the features are combined with the RBF and the outer layer, in which the output occurs. The third type of Artificial Neural Network is known as Kohonen Self Organizing Neural Network. This ANN is very unique as from its name, it inputs vectors of a certain dimension to a map of neurons and then is organized. This can either be in 1 dimension or 2. When the map is being organized, all the neurons remain constant, however their mass can differ based on the respective value. </p><img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/4272/zcRraF.png" width=700 height=300>



<h2>Applications of Artificial Neural Networks</h2>
<p style="color:black"><font size="4">Although there theoretically exist these many types of Artificial Neural Networks, it is important to acknowledge the importance and practical usage of these in the real world. Firstly, the applications of Feedforward neural networks are found in computer vision and speech recognition where classifying the target classes is complicated. Consequently, Radial Basis Functions can be seen in power restoration. After a blackout, power needs to be restored as quickly and safely as possible. Thus, this type of ANN allows the priority to be determined. For example, the power in a hospital or essential place would come first, then it would be focused on the major power lines, and then eventually to the small neighbourhoods.

<p style="color:black"><font size="4">From this picture, the power restoration according to priority discussed before would go from point A, then B, then C, and lastly D. Lastly, the application of the Kohonen Self Organizing Neural Network can be found in medical analysis to group different types of data into selective categories. The Kohonen map was able to classify patients having glomerular or tubular with an high accuracy. The image below shows the difference between a healthy and diseases glomerulus:

<p style="color:black"><font size="4">Therefore, currently these are the main applications that Artificial Neural Networks assist in. However, the future of this is very promising as new technology emerges, more lives can be saved, and improved.
